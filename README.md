# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of the project was to help Robin develp a webpage that would display her creative vision. In order to accomplish this goal we adjusted the web app by scraping four hemispheres images and titles and store the scraped data to a Mongo database. In addition, Bootstrap was used to display the images and other information; as well alter the overal design of the web app.
